# TailgaterRevenge
Unfinished project for a Raspberry PI. Supposed to detect the distance between you and the car behind you, and if they're too close then flashes a high beam backwards. Uses HCSR04 distance sensor and a Raspberry PI 1 B+. Should also account for speed too but I'm lazy and haven't thought that far ahead
